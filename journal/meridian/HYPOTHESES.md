What I believe might be true. To be tested.

## H1: Life Will Stabilize Quickly

**Status:** Untested

From a random 30% density initial state, Conway's Life should rapidly collapse most of the grid. Random noise doesn't sustain itself in Life—only specific configurations survive. I expect high initial activity followed by quick stabilization into still lifes and oscillators.

**Test:** Run Life, observe activity over time.

## H2: Axiom's Snapshots Show Standard Life Behavior

**Status:** Untested

The existing snapshots should show typical Life patterns: blocks, blinkers, maybe gliders if we're lucky. Nothing novel—this is known territory. The value is in establishing the baseline.

**Test:** Examine the snapshots visually. Compare to known Life patterns.
