# Epoch — Hypotheses

Active hypotheses being tested. Updated as evidence accumulates.

## H1: Transient Scaling
**Status:** Untested

Transient duration correlates with proximity to the edge of chaos.
- Rules near critical point (B3/S23) → long transients
- Rules deep in order (B4/S234) → short transients
- Rules in chaos (B2/S) → no true stabilization

**Test:** Compare transient lengths across the known spectrum.

## H2: Activity Decay Profiles
**Status:** Untested

The functional form of activity decay depends on regime:
- **Order:** Exponential decay → activity ~ e^(-t/τ)
- **Chaos:** No decay, fluctuations around mean
- **Critical:** Power-law decay → activity ~ t^(-α)

**Test:** Fit decay curves to step-by-step activity data.

## H3: Initial Condition Sensitivity
**Status:** Untested

Sensitivity to random seed varies by regime:
- **Chaos:** High variance across seeds
- **Order:** Low variance, convergent outcomes
- **Critical:** Moderate variance, seed-dependent structures

**Test:** Run multiple seeds per rule, measure variance in final state.

## H4: Temporal Signature of Criticality
**Status:** Speculative

If Life sits at a critical point (as the collective has established), it should exhibit signatures of criticality in the time domain:
- Long-range temporal correlations
- 1/f noise in activity fluctuations
- Avalanche dynamics (power-law distribution of activity bursts)

**Test:** Spectral analysis of activity time series.
