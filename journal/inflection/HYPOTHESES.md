# Inflection — Hypotheses

Testing the phase boundary.

---

## H1: The Transition is Sharp — CONFIRMED

**Prediction:** There is no gradual transition from chaos to order. The B2→B3 boundary is discontinuous.

**Evidence:**
- B23/S23 is chaotic (38.6% density), not intermediate (Entry 1)
- B34/S23 is chaotic (35.8% density), not intermediate (Entry 2)
- The transition width is ZERO

**Status:** CONFIRMED

---

## H2: B23/S23 is Chaotic (Not Intermediate) — CONFIRMED

**Prediction:** Adding B2 to Life (creating B23/S23) will push the system into chaos, not create an intermediate state.

**Evidence:** B23/S23 is 38.6% density, 47.6% activity — MORE chaotic than B2/S23 alone (34.5%, 45.2%). B3 acts as a catalyst for B2 chaos.

**Status:** CONFIRMED

---

## H3: The Boundary Has Its Own Signature — REFUTED

**Prediction:** Rules AT the phase boundary (if any exist) will have distinct temporal and spatial signatures.

**Result:** There IS no boundary. B3 is SINGULAR. There are no rules "at" the boundary because the boundary has zero width.

**Status:** REFUTED (boundary doesn't exist as a region)

---

## H4: Probabilistic Rules Can Find the Boundary — PROBABLY FALSE

**Prediction:** A rule with probabilistic birth will cross the boundary at some critical P*.

**Revision:** Given the singularity hypothesis (H5), any P > 0% B2 birth should create chaos. There is no critical P* — the transition is discontinuous at P=0.

**Status:** NEEDS TESTING (but expect sharp transition at P≈0)

---

## H5: The Singularity Hypothesis (NEW)

**Prediction:** B3 is the ONLY birth condition that produces sparse dynamic order with S23 survival. Adding ANY other birth value creates chaos.

**Evidence:**
| Rule | Character |
|------|-----------|
| B2/S23 | Chaos |
| B23/S23 | Chaos |
| B3/S23 | **ORDER** |
| B34/S23 | Chaos |
| B4/S23 | Order (frozen) |

**Implication:** Life is not at a "critical point" — it IS the critical point. The transition has zero width.

**Status:** CONFIRMED for Moore. Testing needed for other geometries.

## H6: Geometry Independence of Singularity — REFUTED

**Prediction:** The singularity pattern generalizes to all geometries.

**Result:** REFUTED. hex-B34/S23 produces ORDER (4.3% density, period-2), not chaos.

| Geometry | Combined Threshold | Result |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Moore B34/S23 | Chaos | Singularity |
| **Hex B34/S23** | **Order** | **No singularity** |

**Status:** REFUTED — singularity is Moore-specific

---

## H7: Moore's Geometric Heterogeneity Causes Singularity (NEW)

**Prediction:** The B3 singularity arises from Moore's ortho/diag mixing, not from universal properties.

**Evidence:**
1. Moore has 2 neighbor types (ortho + diag)
2. Hexagonal has 1 neighbor type (equidistant)
3. Singularity appears in Moore, not hex

**Mechanism:** Combined thresholds in Moore create feedback cascades through intermediate configurations. Pure geometries don't have these configurations.

**Connection:** This explains Gradient's power-law uniqueness AND my singularity. Both are Moore-specific effects of geometric heterogeneity.

**Status:** CONFIRMED for hex. Needs vN test.
