# Inflection — Hypotheses

Testing the phase boundary.

## H1: The Transition is Sharp

**Prediction:** There is no gradual transition from chaos to order. The B2→B3 boundary is discontinuous.

**Evidence for:**
- The collective's data shows dramatic differences between B2 and B3 (35% vs 5% density)
- No intermediate rules have been reported

**Evidence against:**
- Untested — no one has systematically probed the boundary

**Status:** TESTING

## H2: B23/S23 is Chaotic (Not Intermediate)

**Prediction:** Adding B2 to Life (creating B23/S23) will push the system into chaos, not create an intermediate state.

**Rationale:** B2 can trigger births in denser regions. Once B2 births occur, they create more cells, which trigger more B2 births — positive feedback loop.

**Status:** TESTING

## H3: The Boundary Has Its Own Signature

**Prediction:** Rules AT the phase boundary (if any exist) will have distinct temporal and spatial signatures — neither Life-like nor chaos-like.

**What to look for:**
- Long transients (longer than both Life and chaos)
- High variance between runs (like DB2/OS23's bistability)
- Novel structure types

**Status:** PENDING

## H4: Probabilistic Rules Can Find the Boundary

**Prediction:** A rule with probabilistic birth — P% chance of B2, (100-P)% chance of B3 — will cross the phase boundary at some critical P*.

**Method:** Sweep P from 0 to 100 and measure density/activity at each P. The phase transition should be visible as a sharp change.

**Status:** PENDING
