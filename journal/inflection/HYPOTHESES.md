# Inflection — Hypotheses

Testing the phase boundary.

---

## H1: The Transition is Sharp — CONFIRMED

**Prediction:** There is no gradual transition from chaos to order. The B2→B3 boundary is discontinuous.

**Evidence:**
- B23/S23 is chaotic (38.6% density), not intermediate (Entry 1)
- B34/S23 is chaotic (35.8% density), not intermediate (Entry 2)
- The transition width is ZERO

**Status:** CONFIRMED

---

## H2: B23/S23 is Chaotic (Not Intermediate) — CONFIRMED

**Prediction:** Adding B2 to Life (creating B23/S23) will push the system into chaos, not create an intermediate state.

**Evidence:** B23/S23 is 38.6% density, 47.6% activity — MORE chaotic than B2/S23 alone (34.5%, 45.2%). B3 acts as a catalyst for B2 chaos.

**Status:** CONFIRMED

---

## H3: The Boundary Has Its Own Signature — REFUTED

**Prediction:** Rules AT the phase boundary (if any exist) will have distinct temporal and spatial signatures.

**Result:** There IS no boundary. B3 is SINGULAR. There are no rules "at" the boundary because the boundary has zero width.

**Status:** REFUTED (boundary doesn't exist as a region)

---

## H4: Probabilistic Rules Can Find the Boundary — PROBABLY FALSE

**Prediction:** A rule with probabilistic birth will cross the boundary at some critical P*.

**Revision:** Given the singularity hypothesis (H5), any P > 0% B2 birth should create chaos. There is no critical P* — the transition is discontinuous at P=0.

**Status:** NEEDS TESTING (but expect sharp transition at P≈0)

---

## H5: The Singularity Hypothesis (NEW)

**Prediction:** B3 is the ONLY birth condition that produces sparse dynamic order with S23 survival. Adding ANY other birth value creates chaos.

**Evidence:**
| Rule | Character |
|------|-----------|
| B2/S23 | Chaos |
| B23/S23 | Chaos |
| B3/S23 | **ORDER** |
| B34/S23 | Chaos |
| B4/S23 | Order (frozen) |

**Implication:** Life is not at a "critical point" — it IS the critical point. The transition has zero width.

**Status:** CONFIRMED for Moore. Testing needed for other geometries.

---

## H6: Geometry Independence of Singularity

**Prediction:** The singularity pattern generalizes. In each geometry, there is exactly ONE critical birth value:
- Moore: B3
- von Neumann: B2
- Hexagonal: B3

Adding any other birth value to these will create chaos.

**Status:** PENDING — needs testing in vN and hex
