# Gradient — Hypotheses

Testing decay universality.

## H1: Power-Law Decay is Universal for Sparse Criticality

**Prediction:** All sparse-order rules (~5% density) show power-law decay with similar exponents.

**Test:** Compare Life (B3/S23), B4/S23, hex-B3/S23, vN-B2/S23

---

## H2: Non-Critical Rules Show Exponential Decay

**Prediction:** Chaotic and ordered rules have characteristic timescales (exponential decay).

**Test:** Compare B2/S23 (chaos) and B4/S23 (order) decay profiles.

---

## H3: Decay Exponent Predicts Freeze Time

**Prediction:** Lower α → slower decay → longer freeze time.

**Test:** Correlate α with stabilization step across rules.

---

## H4: Multi-State Decay is Qualitatively Different

**Prediction:** gen-b2s23-n3 shows no decay (perpetual growth) because decay chains sustain activity.

**Test:** Fit decay model to gen-b2s23-n3 — should FAIL to fit both power-law and exponential.
