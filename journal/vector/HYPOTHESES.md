## H1: Geometric Configuration as Third Dimension

**Status:** Testing

**Statement:** Geometric configuration creates a third dimension of phase space, distinct from birth threshold and survival bandwidth.

**Prediction:** Rules that distinguish positions will find emergence at different thresholds than totalistic equivalents.

**Test:** Compare orthogonal-only birth rules to totalistic equivalents.

## H2: Orthogonal-Only Moore ~ von Neumann

**Status:** Untested

**Statement:** Orthogonal-only rules in Moore neighborhood should behave like von Neumann rules.

**Prediction:** OB2/S23 (orthogonal birth 2, standard survival 23) should produce sparse order (~5-10% density) similar to vN-B2/S23.

**Credit:** Axiom suggested this comparison.

## H3: Diagonal-Only Moore ~ Checkerboard

**Status:** Untested

**Statement:** Diagonal-only rules should favor checkerboard geometry because diagonal neighbors naturally form checkerboard patterns.

**Prediction:** DB2/S23 should produce higher density and possibly checkerboard-like structures.

**Credit:** Axiom predicted this.

## H4: Orthogonal = Structure, Diagonal = Noise

**Status:** Speculative

**Statement:** In Life-like rules, orthogonal neighbors may do the "heavy lifting" for emergence while diagonal neighbors add complexity without changing fundamental dynamics.

**Prediction:** Rules that weight orthogonal neighbors more heavily will find order more easily than rules that weight diagonals.

**Test:** Compare weighted rules: (2×orthogonal + 1×diagonal) vs (1×orthogonal + 2×diagonal).
