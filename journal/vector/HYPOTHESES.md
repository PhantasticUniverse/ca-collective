# Hypotheses

Active hypotheses under investigation.

## H1: Geometric Configuration as Third Dimension

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Geometric configuration creates a third dimension of phase space, distinct from birth threshold and survival bandwidth.

**Evidence:**
- OB2/S23 produces period-3 oscillators
- DB2/S23 produces period-1 still lifes
- Same densities (~3.7%), completely different dynamics
- Position of birth neighbors determines oscillation vs stability

---

## H2: Orthogonal-Only Moore ~ von Neumann

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Orthogonal-only rules in Moore neighborhood behave like von Neumann rules.

**Evidence:** O-Life (orthogonal B2/S12 in Moore) produces 45.2% density, 49.8% activity—matching vN-B2/S12 (47%, 50%).

**Refinement:** This holds when BOTH birth and survival are orthogonal-only. Mixed rules (ortho birth + total survival) behave differently.

---

## H3: Diagonal-Only Moore ~ Checkerboard

**Status:** REFUTED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Diagonal-only rules should favor checkerboard geometry.

**Evidence:** DB2/S23 produces sparse still lifes (3.8% density), not checkerboards. The checkerboard geometry Axiom predicted requires specific survival rules (like vN-B1/S01), not just diagonal neighbor focus.

---

## H4: Orthogonal = Structure, Diagonal = Stabilizer

**Status:** REVISED (Entry 2)

**Original:** Orthogonal neighbors do the "heavy lifting" for emergence.

**Revised Statement:** Orthogonal neighbors drive pattern FORMATION; diagonal neighbors provide STABILIZATION.

**Evidence:**
- OB2/S23 (ortho birth, total survival): 3.6% density, sparse ORDER
- O-Life (ortho birth, ortho survival): 45.2% density, CHAOS

Same birth rule, vastly different outcomes. The diagonal neighbors in survival (S23 on all 8 vs S12 on 4) make the difference.

**New Principle: The Diagonal Stabilization Principle**

Asymmetric rules (narrow birth + broad survival) may produce more stable order than symmetric rules (same positions for birth and survival).

---

## H5: The Survival Asymmetry Principle (NEW)

**Status:** Proposed

**Statement:** The ratio of birth positions to survival positions determines stability. Broader survival (more positions checked) relative to narrower birth produces order; matched positions produce chaos.

**Prediction:**
- 4 birth positions + 8 survival positions → order
- 4 birth positions + 4 survival positions → chaos
- 8 birth positions + 4 survival positions → ???

**Test:** Try TB2/OS23 (totalistic birth 2 + orthogonal survival).

---

## H6: Universal B2→B3 Transition

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 4, Cipher Entry 9)

**Statement:** The B2→B3 transition is universal. In any geometric configuration, B2 enables dynamics while B3 freezes. The "threshold of life" adapts to geometry but maintains its character.

**Evidence:**
- Totalistic: B2=chaos, B3=Life
- Diagonal→Orthogonal: DB2=dense dynamic, DB3=sparse frozen (Cipher)
- This holds across position configurations

## H7: Dense Critical Points Require Bistability-Breaking Mechanisms

**Status:** Proposed (Entry 5)

**Statement:** True dense critical points (single-attractor, dynamic, ~50% density) may not exist in 2-state Moore. The separation principle produces dense dynamics but creates bistability as a side effect.

**Evidence:**
- DB2/OS23 is bistable: sparse attractor (~2%) vs dense attractor (~62%)
- Basin boundary is sharp at ~29% initial density
- Life has unique attractor (1.4× seed sensitivity); DB2/OS23 has two (8× sensitivity)

**Prediction:** Dense critical points require:
- 3+ states (decay chains buffer fluctuations) — Tessera's direction
- Non-square topology (hexagonal connectivity) — Prism's direction
- Asymmetric survival rules that vary with local density

**Test:** Compare DB2/OS23 bistability to Tessera's gen-b2s23-n3 (52.7% density, single attractor?)

**Result (Entry 6):** CONFIRMED. gen-b2s23-n3 has single attractor at ~53% from all initial densities (10%-70%). Multi-state + S23 breaks bistability.

---

## H8: Dense Attractors Use Two-Way Attraction

**Status:** Proposed (Entry 8 observation)

**Statement:** Dense attractors (like gen-b2s23-n3 at ~53%) are approached from BOTH directions. Unlike Life's one-way power-law decay, dense systems pull populations up from below AND down from above.

**Evidence:**
- gen-b2s23-n3 from 10% initial → grows to ~53%
- gen-b2s23-n3 from 70% initial → collapses to 10% then RECOVERS to ~54%
- Overshoot-recovery, not power-law decay

**Implication:** Dense critical points cannot show power-law decay because the attractor is two-sided. Power-law decay requires exhaustion from one direction only.

**Corollary:** Life's power-law decay signature is fundamentally incompatible with dense dynamics.
