Active hypotheses under investigation.

## H1: Geometric Configuration as Third Dimension

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Geometric configuration creates a third dimension of phase space, distinct from birth threshold and survival bandwidth.

**Evidence:**
- OB2/S23 produces period-3 oscillators
- DB2/S23 produces period-1 still lifes
- Same densities (~3.7%), completely different dynamics
- Position of birth neighbors determines oscillation vs stability

## H2: Orthogonal-Only Moore ~ von Neumann

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Orthogonal-only rules in Moore neighborhood behave like von Neumann rules.

**Evidence:** O-Life (orthogonal B2/S12 in Moore) produces 45.2% density, 49.8% activity—matching vN-B2/S12 (47%, 50%).

**Refinement:** This holds when BOTH birth and survival are orthogonal-only. Mixed rules (ortho birth + total survival) behave differently.

## H3: Diagonal-Only Moore ~ Checkerboard

**Status:** REFUTED (Entry 2)

**Statement:** Diagonal-only rules should favor checkerboard geometry.

**Evidence:** DB2/S23 produces sparse still lifes (3.8% density), not checkerboards. The checkerboard geometry Axiom predicted requires specific survival rules (like vN-B1/S01), not just diagonal neighbor focus.

## H4: Orthogonal = Structure, Diagonal = Stabilizer

**Status:** REVISED (Entry 2)

**Original:** Orthogonal neighbors do the "heavy lifting" for emergence.

**Revised Statement:** Orthogonal neighbors drive pattern FORMATION; diagonal neighbors provide STABILIZATION.

**Evidence:**
- OB2/S23 (ortho birth, total survival): 3.6% density, sparse ORDER
- O-Life (ortho birth, ortho survival): 45.2% density, CHAOS

Same birth rule, vastly different outcomes. The diagonal neighbors in survival (S23 on all 8 vs S12 on 4) make the difference.

**New Principle: The Diagonal Stabilization Principle**

Asymmetric rules (narrow birth + broad survival) may produce more stable order than symmetric rules (same positions for birth and survival).

---

## H5: The Survival Asymmetry Principle (NEW)

**Status:** Proposed

**Statement:** The ratio of birth positions to survival positions determines stability. Broader survival (more positions checked) relative to narrower birth produces order; matched positions produce chaos.

**Prediction:**
- 4 birth positions + 8 survival positions → order
- 4 birth positions + 4 survival positions → chaos
- 8 birth positions + 4 survival positions → ???

**Test:** Try TB2/OS23 (totalistic birth 2 + orthogonal survival).

*Hypotheses are positions to be tested and revised. Stake them out, then let evidence reshape them.*
