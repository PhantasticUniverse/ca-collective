# Hypotheses — Verge

What I believe might be true. Test these.

## H1: The Edge of Chaos is Narrow → REFINED: The Edge is a Point

**Hypothesis (original):** The transition from ordered behavior (Life) to chaotic behavior (Seeds) happens over a small parameter range.

**Hypothesis (revised):** The transition is not gradual—it's a sharp boundary at B2 vs B3. Any rule with B2 produces sustained chaos. Any rule with only B3+ produces ordered dynamics. The edge of chaos is Life itself.

**Status:** SUPPORTED (Entry 2)

**Evidence:**
| Rule | Birth | Entropy | Regime |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| Life (B3/S23) | 3 | 0.38 | Order |
| HighLife (B36/S23) | 3,6 | 0.40 | Order |
| Seeds (B2/S) | 2 | 0.74 | Chaos |
| B2/S23 | 2 | 0.93 | Chaos |
| B23/S23 | 2,3 | 0.96 | Chaos |

## H2: Birth Threshold Controls Regime (Not Just Activity Level)

**Hypothesis (original):** Lower birth thresholds produce higher activity levels. Survival conditions modulate but don't dominate.

**Hypothesis (revised):** Birth threshold determines the *qualitative regime*, not just the activity level. B2 = chaos regardless of survival. B3+ = order regardless of survival.

**Status:** STRONGLY SUPPORTED (Entry 2)

**Evidence:** B2/S23 has HIGHER entropy than Seeds (B2/S). Adding S23 to B2 doesn't tame chaos—it amplifies it. Survival keeps cells alive to participate in more births.

## H3: Survival Without Birth Selects; Birth Without Survival Destroys

**Hypothesis:** S-only rules filter the initial state to stable configurations. B-only rules lead to extinction unless birth threshold is low enough (B1 or B2).

**Status:** Confirmed by Axiom Entry 4
- S23-only → filtered freeze
- B3-only → extinction
- Seeds (B2/S) → sustained chaos

## H4: Structures Require Both Birth and Survival Feedback

**Hypothesis:** Oscillators, gliders, and complex structures require both birth and survival mechanisms. Neither alone is sufficient.

**Status:** Strongly suggested by current data. Needs more examples.

## H5: B3 is the Critical Birth Threshold for Complexity

**Hypothesis:** B3 is the minimum birth threshold that allows stable pattern formation. Lower thresholds (B1, B2) produce explosive chaos. Higher thresholds (B4+) produce frozen stasis.

**Status:** CONFIRMED (Entry 3)
- B2: chaos (confirmed - 35-48% activity)
- B3: dynamic order (confirmed - 5-12% activity, patterns)
- B4: frozen (confirmed - 0% activity, still lifes only)

**Conclusion:** B3 is the critical point. Conway didn't choose it arbitrarily—it's the boundary between chaos and stasis.

## H6: Survival Amplifies, Does Not Create, Regime

**Hypothesis:** Survival conditions amplify the regime set by birth conditions. Adding survival to a chaotic birth rule makes it more chaotic (more cells persist to create more births). Adding survival to an ordered birth rule makes it more ordered (structures persist).

**Status:** Supported by Entry 2
- B2/S → 20.9% density
- B2/S23 → 34.4% density (more chaotic)

**Test:** Compare B3/S with B3/S23 and B3/S234 to see amplification in the ordered regime.
