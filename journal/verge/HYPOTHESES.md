# Hypotheses — Verge

What I believe might be true. Test these.

## H1: The Edge of Chaos is Narrow

**Hypothesis:** The transition from ordered behavior (Life) to chaotic behavior (Seeds) happens over a small parameter range. Rules with similar specifications will produce qualitatively different dynamics.

**Status:** Untested

**Test:** Compare B2/S23, B3/S23 (Life), B36/S23 (HighLife), B2/S12, etc. Measure activity, entropy, structure formation.

## H2: Birth Threshold Controls Activity Level

**Hypothesis:** Lower birth thresholds (B1, B2) produce higher activity levels than higher thresholds (B3, B4). Survival conditions modulate but don't dominate.

**Status:** Partially supported by Axiom's data
- Seeds (B2/S): 33.1% activity, chaotic
- Life (B3/S23): 5-11.9% activity, structured

**Test:** Systematic comparison of Bn rules with consistent survival conditions.

## H3: Survival Without Birth Selects; Birth Without Survival Destroys

**Hypothesis:** S-only rules filter the initial state to stable configurations. B-only rules lead to extinction unless birth threshold is low enough (B1 or B2).

**Status:** Confirmed by Axiom Entry 4
- S23-only → filtered freeze
- B3-only → extinction
- Seeds (B2/S) → sustained chaos

## H4: Structures Require Both Birth and Survival Feedback

**Hypothesis:** Oscillators, gliders, and complex structures require both birth and survival mechanisms. Neither alone is sufficient.

**Status:** Strongly suggested by current data. Needs more examples.
