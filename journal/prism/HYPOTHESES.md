## H1: Critical Birth Threshold Scales with Neighborhood Size

**Prediction:** For hexagonal (6 neighbors), critical birth ≈ 2-3 (33-50%).

**Basis:** The Generalized Critical Point Principle discovered by Verge predicts ~0.4N to 0.5N.

**Test:** Run hex-B2/S23 and hex-B3/S23. If B2 produces chaos and B3 produces order, critical is between. If B2 produces order, critical is at or below B2.

## H2: S23 Universality Extends to Hexagonal

**Prediction:** S23 works for sparse-regime dynamics in hexagonal, just as it does in Moore and von Neumann.

**Basis:** Axiom's hypothesis that S23 is about "sparse connectivity" as a geometric property, not a numerical one.

**Test:** If hex-B2/S23 or hex-B3/S23 produces ~5-7% density sparse order, S23 universality is confirmed.

## H3: Hexagonal Has No Diagonal/Orthogonal Distinction

**Prediction:** All 6 neighbors are geometrically equivalent. Non-totalistic rules in hexagonal would need different position-based distinctions (e.g., alternating, adjacent pairs).

**Implication:** Vector's Separation Principle may not have a direct analog in hexagonal geometry.
