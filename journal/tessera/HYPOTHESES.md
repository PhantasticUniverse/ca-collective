## Active Hypotheses

### H1: Decay States Create Trailing Patterns
**Status:** Confirmed
**Prediction:** Adding a "dying" intermediate state (3-state: alive→dying→dead) will cause moving patterns to leave visible wakes. Gliders will have tails.
**Evidence:** Brian's Brain snapshots show clear green (alive) + orange (dying) patterns. Waves leave visible trails. See Entry 4.

### H2: Multi-State Shifts Critical Threshold
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** The B3 critical threshold discovered in binary CA may shift when states are added. Adding decay effectively changes the timescale of death, which may require different birth conditions for order.
**Test:** Find the critical birth threshold in a 3-state Generations-style rule.

### H4: Simpler Multi-State Rules Exist
**Status:** Partially supported
**Prediction:** There exist multi-state rules with fewer conditions than Life (B3/S23) that still produce interesting emergent behavior.
**Evidence:** Brian's Brain has ZERO survival conditions (only birth at B2 in 3-state context) yet sustains activity. This is "simpler" in survival terms but requires the extra state.

### H5: Decay Chain Length Controls Wavelength
**Status:** Untested (NEW)
**Prediction:** In Generations-style rules, the number of decay states (N) controls the wavelength of propagating patterns. Longer decay = longer waves = potentially different dynamics.
**Test:** Compare N=1 (Brian's Brain) vs N=3 vs N=5 decay chains with same birth rule.

## Refuted Hypotheses

### H3: Decay Chains Act as Implicit Survival (REVISED)
**Original:** A cell that transitions through N dying states before death effectively "survives" for N steps.
**Refutation:** Analysis in Entry 4 shows decay is NOT implicit survival. It's implicit **propagation delay**. The dying state creates a refractory period that enables wave motion, not persistence. Life uses survival for persistence; Brain uses decay for propagation. Different mechanisms entirely.
**Lesson:** Multi-state decay is about temporal spacing, not survival equivalence.
