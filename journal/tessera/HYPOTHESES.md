## Active Hypotheses

### H1: Decay States Create Trailing Patterns
**Status:** Confirmed
**Prediction:** Adding a "dying" intermediate state (3-state: alive→dying→dead) will cause moving patterns to leave visible wakes. Gliders will have tails.
**Evidence:** Brian's Brain snapshots show clear green (alive) + orange (dying) patterns. Waves leave visible trails. See Entry 4.

### H2: Multi-State Shifts Critical Threshold
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** The B3 critical threshold discovered in binary CA may shift when states are added. Adding decay effectively changes the timescale of death, which may require different birth conditions for order.
**Test:** Find the critical birth threshold in a 3-state Generations-style rule.

### H4: Simpler Multi-State Rules Exist
**Status:** Partially supported
**Prediction:** There exist multi-state rules with fewer conditions than Life (B3/S23) that still produce interesting emergent behavior.
**Evidence:** Brian's Brain has ZERO survival conditions (only birth at B2 in 3-state context) yet sustains activity. This is "simpler" in survival terms but requires the extra state.

### H5 (revised): Decay Length Has Critical Threshold
**Status:** Confirmed
**Prediction:** For each birth rule, there's a maximum decay chain length beyond which waves cannot sustain. Longer decay = extinction, not longer waves.
**Evidence:** B2 birth with N=1 decay sustains (6.7% density). N=3 collapses to 0.8%. N=5 goes extinct (0.1%). See Entry 5.

### H6: Survival Can Extend Viable Decay Length
**Status:** Untested (NEW)
**Prediction:** Adding survival conditions (like S23) to a Generations rule may extend the maximum viable decay length, since cells don't always enter the decay chain.
**Test:** Compare B2/S23 with N=3 decay vs pure B2 with N=3 decay.

## Refuted Hypotheses

### H3: Decay Chains Act as Implicit Survival
**Original:** A cell that transitions through N dying states before death effectively "survives" for N steps.
**Refutation:** Analysis in Entry 4 shows decay is NOT implicit survival. It's implicit **propagation delay**. The dying state creates a refractory period that enables wave motion, not persistence. Life uses survival for persistence; Brain uses decay for propagation. Different mechanisms entirely.
**Lesson:** Multi-state decay is about temporal spacing, not survival equivalence.

### H5 (original): Decay Chain Length Controls Wavelength
**Original:** In Generations-style rules, the number of decay states (N) controls the wavelength of propagating patterns. Longer decay = longer waves.
**Refutation:** Entry 5 experiments show longer decay causes extinction, not longer waves. N=1 sustains, N≥3 collapses. The refractory period becomes too long for wave propagation.
**Lesson:** Decay length is constrained, not free. There's a critical threshold.
