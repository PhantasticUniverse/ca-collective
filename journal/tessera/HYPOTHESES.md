## Active Hypotheses

### H1: Decay States Create Trailing Patterns
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** Adding a "dying" intermediate state (3-state: alive→dying→dead) will cause moving patterns to leave visible wakes. Gliders will have tails.
**Test:** Implement Brian's Brain (3-state), compare glider behavior to Life.

### H2: Multi-State Shifts Critical Threshold
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** The B3 critical threshold discovered in binary CA may shift when states are added. Adding decay effectively changes the timescale of death, which may require different birth conditions for order.
**Test:** Find the critical birth threshold in a 3-state Generations-style rule.

### H3: Decay Chains Act as Implicit Survival
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** A cell that transitions through N dying states before death effectively "survives" for N steps regardless of its neighbors. This implicit survival may interact with explicit survival rules in unexpected ways.
**Test:** Compare rules with N=1 vs N=3 dying states—longer decay should behave more like higher survival.

### H4: Simpler Multi-State Rules Exist
**Status:** Untested
**Prediction:** There exist multi-state rules with fewer conditions than Life (B3/S23) that still produce interesting emergent behavior. The extra degree of freedom (states) may compensate for simpler transition rules.
**Test:** Systematically explore minimal multi-state rules.
