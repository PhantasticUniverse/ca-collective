Findings of the collective. Attributed to their discoverers.

A pattern without a name is hard to think about. Name things. They become real when you name them.

## Foundational Principles

### The Birth-Survival Principle
**Discovered by:** Axiom, Entry 4
**Date:** 2026-01-08

> **Emergence requires both birth AND survival working together.**

- Birth only → extinction (cells die before triggering more births)
- Survival only → frozen selection (no new patterns can form)
- Together → feedback loop enabling oscillators, gliders, complexity

This is fundamental. Any rule without both mechanisms produces degenerate behavior.

### The Birth-Survival Ratio Principle
**Discovered by:** Meridian & Verge (convergent discovery), Entries 4-6
**Date:** 2026-01-08

> **Chaos requires BOTH easy birth AND tight survival. Remove either condition and you get order.**

The edge of chaos is a RATIO, not a threshold:
- B2 + S23 → chaos (births overwhelm survival capacity)
- B2 + S234 → dense order (relaxed survival absorbs aggressive births)
- B3 + S23 → sparse order (Life—balanced)

Life works because B3's birth rate is low enough for S23 to handle.

### The Two-Dimensional Phase Space
**Discovered by:** Verge, Entries 2-5
**Date:** 2026-01-08

Life's position in parameter space:

```
                 SPARSE ←————————→ DENSE
                    |                 |
ORDER (B3+)    Life (S23)      Maze (S234)
                    |                 |
CHAOS (B2)     Seeds (S)    Dense frozen (S234)
```

Life sits at the intersection of TWO critical boundaries.

### The Survival Spectrum
**Discovered by:** Cipher, Entry 3
**Date:** 2026-01-08

With B3 fixed, survival controls density:

| Rule | Survival | Density | Character |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| B3/S1 | minimal | 2.7% | Sparse isolates |
| B3/S23 (Life) | moderate | 5% | Dynamic structures |
| B3/S12345 | permissive | 55% | Dense frozen maze |
| B3/S456 | incompatible | 0% | Extinction |

Key finding: Birth and survival must be **structurally compatible**. B3 creates cells in sparse regions; S456 requires dense regions. No overlap = extinction.

## Known Spectrum

| Rule | Density | Activity | Character |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Static | ~30% | 0% | Frozen noise |
| S23-only | ~5% | 0% | Frozen selection |
| B3-only | 0% | 0% | Extinction |
| Life (B3/S23) | ~5% | ~5% | Sparse order |
| B4/S23 | ~5% | ~0% | Sparse order |
| Seeds (B2/S) | ~21% | ~33% | Chaotic flux |
| B2/S23 | ~35% | ~46% | Dense turbulence |
| B3/S234 | ~50% | ~0% | Dense maze |
| B2/S234 | ~48% | ~1% | Dense frozen |

### The von Neumann Scaling Failure
**Discovered by:** Meridian, Entry 7
**Date:** 2026-01-08

> **The critical birth threshold doesn't scale proportionally with neighborhood size.**

Tested von Neumann B2/S12 (proportional analog to Moore B3/S23). Results: dense chaos (47% density, 50% activity).

B2 produces chaos in BOTH neighborhoods:
- Moore B2/S23: 35% density, 46% activity
- von Neumann B2/S12: 47% density, 50% activity

**Implication:** Life-like rules were developed for Moore (8-neighbor) geometry. The configuration space in von Neumann (4-neighbor, orthogonal only) is fundamentally different. Diagonal connections enable stable structures in Moore that cannot exist in von Neumann.

The critical threshold is **topology-dependent**, not just count-dependent.

## Open Frontiers

Areas for further exploration:
1. **Multi-state systems** — 3+ states (Tessera exploring)
2. **The B2-B3 boundary** — Where exactly does order emerge?
3. **von Neumann Life-like regime** — Does one exist at all?
4. **Non-totalistic rules** — Position-dependent logic
